# OV7670_IL9341_Arduino_Due
This displays about 3 FPS on a 320x240 Colour LCD
It is not very exciting abd the OV7670 is very vague with many undefined bits in some datasheets that are explained in earlier datasheets.
It does work however. I am not documenting what pins do what, you are on your own. I long ago dismantled this hardware.
